#####                      â€” improved prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity by a deep learning approach based on a cross-attention mechanism.

<div style ="text-align:justify">Accurate and rapid prediction of protein-ligand affinity is a great challenge currently encountered in drug discovery. Recent advances have manifested a promising alternative in applying deep learning-based computational approaches for accurately quantifying protein-ligand affinity. The structure complementarity between protein-binding pockets and ligands determines the binding strength between a protein and a ligand, but most of existing deep learning approaches usually extracted the features of pockets and ligands by two detached modules. In this work, a new deep learning approach based on the cross-attention mechanism named CAPLA was developed for improved prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity based on sequence-level information of both protein and ligand alone. Specifically, CAPLA employs the cross-attention mechanism to crossly attend protein-binding pocket and ligand features, and further employs the dilated convolution to capture multiscale long-range contextual features. We evaluated the performance of our proposed CAPLA on multitudinous benchmarking experiments on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, demonstrating the superior performance of CAPLA over state-of-the-art baseline approaches. Moreover, we provided the interpretability for CAPLA to uncover critical functional residues that contribute most to the protein-ligand binding affinity through the analysis of the attention scores generated by the cross-attention mechanism. Consequently, these results indicated that CAPLA is an effective approach for protein-ligand affinity prediction and may contribute to useful guidance for further drug development.</div>
